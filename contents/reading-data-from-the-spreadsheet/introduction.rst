Introduction To The API
=======================

How It Works
------------

The API works by using a digitally signed ``http`` request (either ``GET`` or ``POST``).

A set of public and private keys is generated on the Vixo site and these are used to sign the requests.

The API is based on the Amazon Web Services digitially signed api.
