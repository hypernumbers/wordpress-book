Things The API Can't Do
=======================

API Restrictions
----------------

There are a number of actions that the Vixo GUI takes that are not accessible via the api.

These are substantially those actions needed to support a working, usable, responsive, spreadsheet GUI.

There is no dimunition of the power of the API by making these exclusions.

The restricted actions fall into two categories:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   Administrative Actions <administrative-actions>
   Logging Actions        <logging-actions>
